JeeNodeJR 0.1

credits
  . based on jcw's <jcw@equi4.com> JeeNode work and protocol
  . uart implementation based on work from njc and hodgepig

  . rfm12b bitbang spi based on simpleavr's spectrum analyzer
    http://www.simpleavr.com/msp430-projects/rfm12b-spectrum-analyzer
  . JeeLabsAndy provides msp430g2553 h/w/ spi code

objective
  . implements JeeNode protocal on msp430 low-end devices
  . provide basic subset of JeeNode library apis
  . be able to talk to original JeeNodes (AVR) 

known differences w/ JeeNode (AVR)
  . default rf module bitrate is 4.8kbps instead of 49.2kbps
  . does not support "easy" transmission functions yet
  . does not support eeprom config r/w yet

0.1 features (2011-09-12)
  . provides the following rfm12b functions via rfm.h
    . rf12_initialize()
	. rf12_canSend()
	. rf12_sendStart()
	. rf12_recvDone()
	. plus some other internal functions
  . provides the following uart functions via uart.h
    . uart_init()
	. uart_getc()
	. uart_putc()
	. plus some other, see source code
  . communicates w/ rfm12b via spi
  . choice of h/w spi or bitbang spi
  . tested on msp430g2211/g2231/f2012/g2452
  . should work on most low-end msp430 devices
